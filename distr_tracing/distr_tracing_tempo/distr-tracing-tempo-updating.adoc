Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) controls the installation, upgrade, and role-based access control (RBAC) of Operators in a cluster. The OLM runs by default in {product-title}.
OLM queries for available Operators as well as upgrades for installed Operators.
For more information about how {product-title} handles upgrades, see the xref:../../operators/understanding/olm/olm-understanding-olm.adoc#olm-understanding-olm[Operator Lifecycle Manager] documentation.

During an update, the {DTProductName} Operators upgrade the managed {DTShortName} instances to the version associated with the Operator. Whenever a new version of the {TempoName} Operator is installed, all the {TempoShortName} application instances managed by the Operator are upgraded to the Operator's version. For example, after upgrading the Operator from 1.10 installed to 1.11, the Operator scans for running {TempoShortName} instances and upgrades them to 1.11 as well.

For instructions on how to update the Operator channel, see xref:../../operators/admin/olm-upgrading-operators.adoc[Updating installed Operators].
