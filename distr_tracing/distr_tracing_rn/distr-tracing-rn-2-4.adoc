== New features and enhancements

This release adds support for auto-provisioning certificates using the Red Hat Elasticsearch Operator.

* Self-provisioning, which means using the {JaegerName} Operator to call the Red Hat Elasticsearch Operator during installation.
Self provisioning is fully supported with this release.
* Creating the Elasticsearch instance and certificates first and then configuring the {JaegerShortName} to use the certificate is a Technology Preview for this release.

[NOTE]
====
When upgrading to the {DTProductName} 2.4, the Operator recreates the Elasticsearch instance, which might take five to ten minutes.
Distributed tracing will be down and unavailable for that period.
