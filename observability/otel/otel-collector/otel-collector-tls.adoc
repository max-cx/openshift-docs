Use the following TLS configuration in the OpenTelemetry Collector custom resource:

// Is this a client-side configuration only? [Yes/No]
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
        tls: # <1>
          ca_file: ca.pem
          cert_file: cert.pem
          client_ca_file: client.pem # <2>
          client_ca_file_reload: false # <3>
          key_file: key.pem
          insecure: false # <4>
          insecure_skip_verify: false # <5>
          reload_interval: 1h # <6>
          server_name_override: <name> # <7>

----
<1> Client-side TLS configuration. Defines paths to TLS certificates.
<2> Path to the TLS certificate at which the server verifies a client certificate. This sets the value of `ClientCAs` and `ClientAuth` to `RequireAndVerifyClientCert` in the `TLSConfig`. For more information, see the link:https://godoc.org/crypto/tls#Config[`Config` of the Golang TLS package].
<3> Reloads the `client_ca_file` file when it is modified. This is disabled by default.
<4> Disables client transport security when set to `true`. The default value is `false`.
<5> Skips verifying the certificate when set to `true`. The default value is `false`.
<6> Specifies the time interval at which the certificate is reloaded. If the value is not set, the certificate is never reloaded. Accepts a string that contains valid units of time such as `ns`, `us` or `Âµs`, `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`.
<7> Overrides the virtual host name of the authority: for example, the authority header field in requests. You can use this for testing.
