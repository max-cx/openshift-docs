== Sending traces and metrics to the OpenTelemetry collector without the sidecar injection

.Procedure

In this case, it is needed to configure manually the environment variables needed
to send telemetry data to an OpenTelemetry Collector instance.


First we need to create a Project where our OpenTelemtry Collector will be deployed.

Create a Project where our workloads will be deployed.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: project.openshift.io/v1
kind: Project
metadata:
  name: observability
----
====

Create a ServiceAccount.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: otel-collector-deployment
  namespace: observability
----

Grant permissions to the ServiceAccount for the k8sattributes and
resourcedetection processors.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: otel-collector
rules:
- apiGroups: ["", "config.openshift.io"]
  resources: ["pods", "namespaces", "infrastructures", "infrastructures/status"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: otel-collector

- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: otel-collector-sidecar

roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: otel-collector

Deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector as deployment

          exporters: [otlp]

After that, you will need to set the following environment variables in the container
with your instrumented application.

[options="header"]
[cols="l, a, a"]
|===
|Name |Description |Default value
|OTEL_SERVICE_NAME
|Sets the value of the service.name resource attribute.
|""

|OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
|A base endpoint URL for any signal type, with an optionally-specified port number.
|https://localhost:4317

|OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_CERTIFICATE
|Path to the certificate file for TLS credentials of gRPC client.
|https://localhost:4317

|OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER
|Sampler to be used for trace.
|parentbased_always_on

|OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL
|Transport protocol for the OTLP exporter
|grpc

|OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TIMEOUT
|Maximum time the OTLP exporter will wait for each batch export.
|10s

|OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE
|Disable client transport security for gRPC requests. An https schema takes precedence over this configuration setting.
|False
