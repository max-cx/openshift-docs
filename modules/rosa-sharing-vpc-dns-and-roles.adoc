= Creating your DNS and cluster creation roles

After the *VPC-owning AWS account* user creates a virtual private cloud, subnets, and an IAM role for sharing the VPC resources, the *cluster-creating AWS account* user must reserve an `openshiftapps.com` DNS domain and create Operator roles to communicate back to the *VPC-owning AWS account*.

.Prerequisites

* You have the ARN for the IAM role that is used to share your VPC.

.Procedure

. The cluster creator reserves an `openshiftapps.com` DNS domain with the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create dns-domain
----
+
The command creates a reserved `openshiftapps.com` DNS domain.
+
[source,terminal]
----
I: DNS domain '14eo.p1.openshiftapps.com' has been created.
I: To view all DNS domains, run 'rosa list dns-domains'
----
. After creating the DNS domain, the *cluster-creating AWS account* user needs to create an OIDC configuration. Review this article for more information link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7031018[on the ODIC configuration process]. The following command produces the OIDC config ID that you need:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create oidc-config
----
+
You receive confirmation that the command created an OIDC configuration.
+
[source,terminal]
----
I: To create Operator Roles for this OIDC Configuration, run the following command and remember to replace <user-defined> with a prefix of your choice:
	rosa create operator-roles --prefix <user-defined> --oidc-config-id 25tu67hq45rto1am3slpf5lq6jargg
----
. After the OIDC configuration is created, create the Operator roles by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create operator-roles --oidc-config-id <oidc-config-ID> <1>
    --installer-role-arn <Installer_Role> <2>
    --shared-vpc-role-arn <Created_VPC_Role_Arn> <3>
    --prefix <operator-prefix> <4>
----
+
--
<1> Provide the OIDC configuration ID that you created in the previous step.
<2> Provide the cluster creator's installer ARN that was created as part of the `rosa create account-roles` process.
<3> Provide the ARN for the role that the *VPC-owning AWS account* created.
<4> Provide a prefix for the Operator roles.
--
+
[NOTE]
====
The Installer account role and the shared VPC role must have a one-to-one relationship. If you want to create multiple shared VPC roles, you should create one set of account roles per shared VPC role.
====

After you create the Operator roles, share the full domain name, which is created with `<intended_cluster_name>.<created_dns_domain>`, your _Ingress Operator Cloud Credentials_ and _Installer_ roles' ARN with the *VPC-owning AWS account* user.

This information resembles these examples:

* ``my-rosa-cluster.14eo.p1.openshiftapps.com``
* ``arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/ManagedOpenShift-Installer-Role``
* ``arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/my-rosa-cluster-openshift-ingress-operator-cloud-credentials``
