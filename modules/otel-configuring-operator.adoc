You can make several configuration choices for the {OTELOperator} by editing the `Subscription` object.

[TIP]
====
If you are a terminal user, you can skip the web console and edit the YAML configuration for the `Subscription` object by running the following command during an active {oc-first} session:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit subscription opentelemetry-operator -n openshift-opentelemetry-operator
----
====

. In the web console, navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
