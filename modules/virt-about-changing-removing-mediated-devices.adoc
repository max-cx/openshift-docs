= About changing and removing mediated devices

The cluster's mediated device configuration can be updated with {VirtProductName} by:

* Editing the `HyperConverged` CR and change the contents of the `mediatedDevicesTypes` stanza.

* Changing the node labels that match the `nodeMediatedDeviceTypes` node selector.

* Removing the device information from the `spec.mediatedDevicesConfiguration` and `spec.permittedHostDevices` stanzas of the `HyperConverged` CR.

[NOTE]
====
If you remove the device information from the `spec.permittedHostDevices` stanza without also removing it from the `spec.mediatedDevicesConfiguration` stanza, you cannot create a new mediated device type on the same node. To properly remove mediated devices, remove the device information from both stanzas.
====

Depending on the specific changes, these actions cause {VirtProductName} to reconfigure mediated devices or remove them from the cluster nodes.
