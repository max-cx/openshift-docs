[id="distr-tracing-otel-migrating-from-jaeger-with-sidecars_{context}"]
= (Temporary title) Migrating from {JaegerName} to {OTELName} with sidecars

.Prerequisites

* {JaegerName} is used on the cluster.
* {OTELName} is installed.

.Procedure

The {OTELName} Operator can inject sidecars into Deployment workloads.

Configure OpenTelemetry Collector as sidecar

Create a Service Account for running your application:

----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: otel-collector-sidecar
----

Create a ClusterRole for the permissions needed by some processors

----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: otel-collector-sidecar
rules:
# Permissions for infrastructures and infrastructures/status are needed for resourcedetectionprocessor
- apiGroups: ["config.openshift.io"]
  resources: ["infrastructures", "infrastructures/status"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
----

Create a ClusterRoleBinding to give those permissions to the Service Account

----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: otel-collector-sidecar
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount

Remove the injected Jaeger Agent from your application

To remove the automatic sidecar injection from the Jaeger Operator, you need to remove the "sidecar.jaegertracing.io/inject": "true" annotation from your Deployment.
Enable automatic injection of the OpenTelemetry sidecar

To enable automatic injection of the OpenTelemetry sidecar, add the sidecar.opentelemetry.io/inject: "true" annotation to the .spec.template.metadata.annotations field of your Deployment.
Use the created Service Account for your deployment

Use the Service Account we created before (otel-collector-sidecar) for the deployment of your application. This will allow the processors to get the correct information and add it to your traces.
