. After updating the trust policy, the *VPC-owning AWS account* user creates a private hosted zone in the link:https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/route53/v2/[Route 53 section of the AWS console]. In the hosted zone configuration, the domain name is `<cluster-name>.<dns_domain>`. The private hosted zone must be associated with the created VPC.
. After the hosted zone is created and associated with the VPC, provide the following to the *cluster-creating AWS account* user:
* Hosted zone ID
* AWS region
* Intended subnet IDs
