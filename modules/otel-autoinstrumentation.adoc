= Auto-instrumentation in the {OTELOperator}

Auto-instrumentation in the {OTELOperator} is the capability to automatically instrument an application without manual code changes. This enables developers and administrators to get observability into applications with minimal effort and changes to the existing codebase.

Auto-instrumentation involves the following processes:

1. The {OTELOperator} injects an init-container, or a sidecar container for Go, to add the instrumentation libraries for the programming language of the instrumented application.

2. The {OTELOperator} sets the required environment variables in the application's runtime environment. These variables configure the auto-instrumentation libraries to collect traces, metrics, and logs and send them to the appropriate OpenTelemetry Collector or another telemetry backend.

3. The injected libraries automatically instrument your application by hooking into known frameworks and libraries, such as web servers or database clients, to collect telemetry data. This happens without requiring any modifications to the application's source code.

4. Once the application is running with the injected instrumentation, the application automatically starts generating telemetry data, which is sent to a designated OpenTelemetry Collector or an external OTLP endpoint for further processing.

Auto-instrumentation is especially useful when you want to start collecting telemetry data quickly without having to manually integrate the OpenTelemetry SDK into your application code. However, some applications might require specific configurations or custom manual instrumentation for more advanced use cases.
