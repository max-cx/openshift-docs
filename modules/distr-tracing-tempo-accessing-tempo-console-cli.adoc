= Accessing the Tempo console from the CLI

The installation process creates a route to the Tempo console.

You can access the Tempo console by visiting its URL.

You can get the URL on the command line as follows.

.Prerequisites

* {SMProductName} or {DTProductName} is installed.
* The {TempoName} installed, configured, and deployed.
* An active OpenShift CLI (`oc`) session by a cluster administrator with the `cluster-admin` role.
+
[TIP]
====
* Ensure that your OpenShift CLI (`oc`) version is up to date and matches your {product-title} version.

* Run `oc login`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login --username=<your_username> 
----
====

.Procedure

. Query the route details:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export TEMPO_URL=$(oc get route -n <control_plane_namespace> tempo -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
----

. In a web browser, go to `\https://<route_from_previous_step>`.

. Log in using your cluster administrator credentials for the OpenShift web console.

. If you have added services to the service mesh and have generated traces, you can use the filters and the *Find Traces* button to search your trace data.
+
NOTE: The Tempo console initially shows no trace data to display following the Tempo console installation.
