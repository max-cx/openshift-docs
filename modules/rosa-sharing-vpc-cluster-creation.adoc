= Creating your cluster in a shared VPC
To create a cluster in a shared VPC, complete the following step. 

[NOTE]
====
Installing a cluster in a shared VPC is supported only for OpenShift 4.13.9 and later.
====

.Procedure
* In a terminal, the *cluster-creating AWS account* user enters the following command to create the cluster in the shared VPC:

[source,terminal]
----
rosa create cluster --cluster-name <cluster_name> --sts --operator-roles-prefix <prefix> --oidc-config-id <oidc_config_id> --region us-east-1 --subnet-ids <subnet_ids> --private-hosted-zone-id <hosted_zone_ID> --shared-vpc-role-arn <vpc-role-arn> --base-domain <dns-domain>
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
After you delete a shared-VPC cluster, three DNS records will not be removed from the private hosted zone. If you make any subsequent install attempts by using the same values, installation errors will occur.

This issue might also manifest when shared-VPC networking prerequisites are not correctly configured. See this article for more information link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7031016[on this limitation].
