= Configuring a VPC to share within your AWS organization

You can share subnets within a configured VPC with another AWS user account if that account is within your current AWS organization.

.Procedure

. From the AWS account that centrally manages your VPC, create or modify a VPC to your specifications in the link:https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/[VPC section of the AWS console]. This AWS account will be the *VPC-owning AWS account*. 
. In the link:https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/[Identity and Access Management (IAM) section of the AWS console], create a custom trust policy role for the shared VPC permissions. This role needs to have the following permissions:
  * A trust policy to assume roles:

  "Statement": [
    {
	  "Sid": "Statement1",
	  "Effect": "Allow",
	  "Principal": {
	  	"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<Account-ID>:root"

	  "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
	}
  ]
}

<1> The following principals are be added later in this process after the *cluster-creating AWS account* user has created these roles. On creation, you must create a root user placeholder by using the *cluster-creator's AWS Account* ID as `arn:aws:iam::{Account}:root`.
--
    * The `ResourceGroupandTagEditorFullAccess` permissions policy
    * The `Route53minimalPermissions` permissions policy
+
After you create this IAM role, provide the created role's ARN to the cluster creator.

. In the link:https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ram/[Resource Access Manager of the AWS console], create a Resource Share that shares the previously created public and private subnets to the *cluster-creating AWS account* ID.

After you create the Resource Share, notify the *cluster-creating AWS account* user to reserve an `openshiftapps.com` DNS domain and create Operator roles to continue configuration.
