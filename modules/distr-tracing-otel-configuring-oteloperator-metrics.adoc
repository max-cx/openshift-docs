= Configuring {OTELOperator} metrics and alerts

When installing the {OTELOperator} from the web console, you can select the *Enable Operator recommended cluster monitoring on this Namespace* checkbox, which enables creating metrics of the {OTELOperator}.

If the checkbox was not selected during installation, you can manually enable metrics and alerts even after installing the {OTELOperator}.

.Procedure

* Add the `openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"` label in the project where the {OTELOperator} is installed, which is `openshift-opentelemetry-operator` by default.

.Verification

You can use the *Administrator* view of the web console to verify successful configuration:

. Go to *Observe* -> *Targets*, filter for *Source: Platform*, and search for `opentelemetry-operator`, which must have the *Up* status.
