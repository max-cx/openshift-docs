== Bug Fixes

* Before this update, Loki attempted to determine the log level of log messages, which caused confusion when the collector also determined log levels and produced different results. With this update, automatic log level detection in Loki is disabled. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6321[LOG-6321])

* Before this update, the `log_type` for infrastructure namespaces included in application inputs was set to `application`. With this update, the `log_type` for infrastructure namespaces included in application inputs is correctly set to `infrastructure`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6377[LOG-6377])
