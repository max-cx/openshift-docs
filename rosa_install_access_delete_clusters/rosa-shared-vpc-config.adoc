= Configuring a shared virtual private cloud for ROSA clusters
:context: rosa-shared-vpc-config

toc::[]

You can create {product-title} clusters in shared, centrally-managed AWS virtual private clouds (VPCs). This process requires two separate AWS accounts that belong to the same AWS organization. One account functions as the VPC owner while the other account creates the cluster in this VPC.

.Prerequisites
* You installed the ROSA CLI (`rosa`) 1.2.26 or later.
* You created all of the required ROSA account roles for creating a cluster.
* You have an AWS account with the proper permissions to create roles and share resources.
* You are using an AWS account to create your cluster ("*cluster-creating AWS account*") that is separate from the AWS account that creates your VPC ("*VPC-owning AWS account*").
* Both AWS accounts belong to the same AWS organization.
* You enabled resource sharing from the management account for your organization.
* You have access to the link:https://signin.aws.amazon.com[AWS console].

[NOTE]
====
Installing a cluster in a shared VPC is supported only for OpenShift 4.13.9 and later.
